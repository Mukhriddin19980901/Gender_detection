- The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm that can accurately classify an individual's gender (male,female) based on facial features extracted from images.Creating real-time processing of facial images to provide instantaneous gender classification, making the system applicable to live video feeds or applications that require immediate responses.

- For this project I have classified overall 56,000 images to identify a gender of people from different races.The proportion of the classes are here :

> Intially images were relabelled using one hot encoding
> I have built a model using Convolution Neural Networks
> I have used cvlib library - a very effective library for face detection
> The accuracy rate is about 96% on average.
> This model can be used for many purposes such as public security,statistics and so on.

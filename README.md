- For this project I have classified overall 56,000 images to identify a gender of people from different races.
- Intially images were relabelled using one hot encoding
- I have built a model using Convolution Neural Networks
- I have used cvlib library - a very effective library for face detection
- The accuracy rate is about 96% on average.
- This model can be used for many purposes such as public security,statistics and so on.
